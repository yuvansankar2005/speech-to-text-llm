# speech-to-text-llm
üìå Objective:
This project demonstrates how to use speech recognition tools to convert audio files into text, aimed at building transcription services.

üîß Technologies Used:
Python

Jupyter Notebook

SpeechRecognition library

pydub for audio format handling

IPython.display for audio playback

üìÅ Key Sections:
Environment Setup

Installs necessary packages like SpeechRecognition, pydub.

Handles audio conversion and playback within the notebook.

Audio Preprocessing

Converts audio files into the required format (e.g., from MP3 to WAV).

Loads audio files and displays them with IPython.display.Audio.

Transcription with SpeechRecognition

Uses Google Web Speech API to transcribe audio.

Implements error handling for various edge cases (e.g., unintelligible audio or API failures).

Output

Transcription text is printed or stored for further use.

Option to expand with logging, saving to files, or integration into larger pipelines.

‚úÖ Potential Enhancements:
Add support for other STT engines (e.g., Whisper, Vosk, AssemblyAI).

Batch processing of multiple files.

Frontend UI or API for service deployment.
